# MSR19-DataShowcase
Python has gained a lot of popularity in developing Machine Learning (ML) and data science projects in recent time. The number of repositories in Github that incorporates ML techniques and data-intensive tasks is also increasing rapidly. Analyzing these numerous data science Python programs can help to suggest best ML practices, invent novel ML language features,  infer underlying bugs etc. In this paper, we have presented a dataset that includes parsed Python programs from ~2k Github repositories which are focusing on data intensive ML tasks. The dataset is developed under Boa \cite{dyer2013boa} infrastructure and will be available online for running program analysis jobs in parallel fashion.
